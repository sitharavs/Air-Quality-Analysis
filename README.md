🌍 Air Quality Checker
Welcome to the Air Quality Checker!

This tool helps you understand how clean or dirty the air is around you. Just like checking the weather, this lets you check if the air is safe to breathe!

🌫 What Does It Do?
Measures Air Quality: Shows how good or bad the air is.
Uses AQI: AQI stands for Air Quality Index. It’s a score that tells you how safe the air is, from really good to really bad.
Shows Health Effects: It also tells you what might happen if you breathe the air – like if it’s safe to play outside or if you should stay indoors.
📊 Why Use It?
Knowing the air quality is super important! If the air is dirty, you might feel sick or find it hard to breathe, especially if you play sports or exercise outside. This tool helps you make safe choices.

🛠 How to Use It?
Check the AQI Score: Look at the number or color to see how clean or dirty the air is.
Green or low numbers mean the air is clean!
Red or high numbers mean the air might be dangerous.
Follow Safety Tips: Based on the AQI, you’ll know if it’s okay to go outside or if you should stay indoors.
That’s it! Now you’re all set to check the air and keep yourself safe!
